/**
 * Jahia's query service is based on the JCR QueryObjectModelFactory and thus supports all kinds of
 * complex queries specified in JSR-283 (Content Repository for Javaï¿½ Technology API 2.0)
 * 
 * Queries can be created with the API by using the QueryObjectModel.
 * Jahia will also provide a query builder user interface.
 * It is also possible to use SQL-2 and the deprecated XPATH language. 
 * 
 * As Jahia can plug-in multiple repositories via the universal content hub (UCH), the queries can be
 * converted to other languages, like the EntropySoft connector query language.
 * 
 * The query service provides methods to modify and optimize the queries to support and make use of Jahia's 
 * internal data model implementation.
