/**
 * Defines the group for validation constraints, which is validated only if the validation of the default group of constraints succeeds.
 * With this group you could define for example a more functionally-oriented validation constraints, where is in the default group will
 * contain basic validations (like {@link NotNull}, {@link Min}, {@link Max} etc.).<br/>
 * 
 * Assume you have to implement a validation of a mount point node for a remote server, where you have connection parameters in node
 * properties. The default group of constraints will validate if those parameters are not null and eventually validate the syntax. And than
 * a so called "availability" constrain, which is defined in this "advanced" group, will check the remote server availability by
 * establishing a connection to it. If the first group of constraints (default) is not satisfied it is not needed to validate the "advanced"
 * constraints.
